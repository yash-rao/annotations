Component
Autowired
Qualifier - To avoid confusion  between beans when two more class implements same interface.

Primary - To give higher preference to bean when there are multiple beans of same type. It is also alternative to Qualifier

Bean - Indicates that a method produces a bean to be managed by Spring Container. The bean annotation is usually configured in Configuration class to create Spring Bean definitions.
 - By default bean name is same as method name. We can specify bean name using @Bean(name="beanName")
 - @Bean annotation provides initMethod and destroyMethod attributes to perform certain actions before initialization and before destruction by a container.

Stereotype annotations
 - These annotations are used to spring beans automatically in application context(Spring IOC container).
 - The main stereotype annotation is @Component.
 - By using this annotation Spring provides more stereotype meta annotations such as @Service, @Repository and @Controller.
 - @Service annotation is used to create Spring bean at the service layer
 - @Repository is used Spring bean for repo at DAO layer
 - @Controller is used to create spring bean at controller layer.


@Lazy 
 - Spring creates all singleton beans eagerly at the startup of application context
 - You can load spring beans lazily on demand using @Lazy annotation.
 - Lazy can be used with configuration, component and bean annotations.

@Scope
Latest version of Spring framework defines 6 types of scopes
 - Singleton
 - Prototype
 - Request
 - Session
 - Application
 - WebSocket

Last four are available in web-aware application
 - By default beans are singleton
 - Scope annotation is used to define a scope of bean
 - We use a scope to define the scope of component class or bean definition
 - Singleton - Only one instance of bean is created and shared across the entire application.
 - Prototype - new instance of bean is created every time it is requested
 
@Value annotation
 - Spring Value is used to assign default values to variables and method arguments
 - Value annotation is mostly used to get value for specific property key from properties file.
 - We can read spring environment variables as well as system variable using @Value annotation


@PropertySource
 - Used to provide properties file to Spring Environment
@PropertySources 
 - Used to provide multiple properties files to Spring Environment
 - These annotation is used with @Configuration Classes
 

@Controller 
 - Spring provides controller annotation to make java class a spring MVC controller. Controller indicates that a particular class serves the role of controller
 - controller in spring mvc web application is component that handles incoming http request.
 - is simply specialization of component class which allows to auto detect implementation classes through the classpath scanning
 - @Requestmapping
